Physics-Informed Deep Learning for GW Formation Channel Inference

This package implements a comprehensive framework for quantifying astrophysical
uncertainties in gravitational wave formation channels using ensemble population
synthesis codes as Bayesian priors.

Components:
    - compas_ensemble: Large-scale COMPAS simulation grid generation
    - models: Physics-informed neural network architectures
    - inference: Simulation-based inference (SBI) framework
    - falsification: Testing falsification criteria
    - data: GWTC-4 data loading and preprocessing
    - utils: Helper functions and utilities
