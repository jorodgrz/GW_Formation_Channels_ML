# COSMIC Placeholder

COSMIC is installed via pip/conda inside the `gw_channels` environment, but this
directory tracks project-specific notes, configs, and scripts for running COSMIC
ensembles. Populate it with run cards, metadata, or documentation as the COSMIC
integration evolves.

Recommended contents once available:

- `configs/` with YAML/JSON parameter grids
- `scripts/` mirroring the COMPAS AWS helpers
- `notebooks/` showcasing COSMIC vs. COMPAS comparisons

For installation and usage details see `docs/simulator_notes/COSMIC_INTEGRATION.md`.
