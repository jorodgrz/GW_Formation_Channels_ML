## Completed

### Core Infrastructure
- COSMIC ensemble generator operational for rapid local prototyping (100-10k systems per combo)
- Multi-code unified generator executes COMPAS + COSMIC test runs successfully
- SBI training loop functional with default config (event encoder, population aggregator, cross-modal attention, normalizing flows)
- GWTC-4 posteriors downloaded to data/raw/; loader wired to Dataset with synthetic/domain labels
- Configuration system implemented (YAML-driven training/infrastructure configs)
- Experiment tracking with metadata logging and artifact storage in experiments/runs/

### Documentation (December 2025)
- README.md refactored: concise TL;DR, scientific motivation, streamlined pipeline, falsification criteria

- docs/overview/ARCHITECTURE.md: system architecture with full pipeline diagram and falsification tests
- docs/overview/SCIENTIFIC_POSITION.md: core thesis, five pillars (disagreement maps, code identifiability, ranked failures, causal stress tests, astrophysical claims)
- docs/overview/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md: current status snapshot with completed/in-progress/planned breakdowns aligned to progress.txt
- Documentation headers standardized (Purpose / How to use / Back to README) across all overview docs
- docs/operations/ guides: SETUP.md, QUICKSTART.md, QUICKREF.md, AWS_CLUSTER.md
- docs/simulator_notes/ integration details: COMPAS_Info.md, COSMIC_INTEGRATION.md, POSYDON_INTEGRATION.md

## In Progress

### Ensemble Generation
- Deploy COMPAS production 40-combination sparse grid on AWS Batch/EC2
  - Target: ~10^6 binaries total across α_CE, kicks, winds, mass-transfer efficiency grid
  - Upload metadata + HDF5s to S3 and sync locally
  - Status: AWS validated; awaiting cluster allocation and final grid parameters

### Training & Inference
- Implement UnifiedEnsembleGenerator.load_ensemble_for_training
  - Transform COMPAS/COSMIC HDF5 outputs → training tensors (pop_synth_inputs)
  - Integration point: feed into train.py and falsification modules
  - Status: API designed; implementation underway

- Execute end-to-end training run with production COMPAS + COSMIC ensembles
  - Train neural posterior estimator with full hyperparameter grids
  - Generate checkpoints, TensorBoard logs, and trained models
  - Run FalsificationTester to populate results/tables/falsification
  - Validate posteriors against toy models and perform coverage tests

### Analysis & Outputs
- Complete cross-code mutual-information study
  - Compute MI diagnostics across COMPAS/COSMIC (and POSYDON when ready)
  - Quantify epistemic uncertainty at event and population level
  - Generate MI values per event for Test 1 (epistemic dominance)
  - Status: Framework designed; awaiting production ensembles

- Generate GWTC-4 event-level exports
  - Per-event channel posteriors (IB, CE, CHE, dynamical, other)
  - Falsification verdicts (epistemic dominance test, α_CE effectiveness test)
  - Exportable CSV/LaTeX tables for publication
  - Corner plots, attention visualizations, mass/spin/redshift distributions
  - Location: results/tables/, results/figures/

## Planned / Next Milestones

### Testing & Validation
- Add comprehensive unit & integration tests
  - Data loaders, ensemble runners, model forward pass, falsification metrics
  - Extend tests/integration/ beyond current smoke tests
  - Continuous integration setup

### POSYDON Integration Track
- Download POSYDON interpolation grids
  - Command: `posydon-setup-pipeline --download-grids` (~25 GB)
  - Verify grid integrity and compatibility

- Run POSYDON smoke tests
  - 3×100-system validation run
  - Verify CLI wrapper, parameter mapping, HDF5 output schema
  - Confirm metadata matches COMPAS/COSMIC format

- Integrate POSYDON into multi-code generator
  - Port POSYDON population sampler to unified framework
  - Hook up shared parameter grid with start/end index slicing
  - Extend multi-code smoke test to include all three codes

- Update AWS infrastructure for POSYDON
  - Timing benchmarks for grid interpolation vs. rapid codes
  - Storage and compute requirements documentation
  - Production deployment playbook

### Publication & Dissemination
- Prepare publication outputs
  - Finalize figures: mass/spin distributions, corner plots, attention heatmaps
  - Generate tables: hyperparameter constraints, channel fractions, per-event classifications
  - Write falsification summary and uncertainty decomposition results
  - Dependencies: full production runs, MI study, all three codes operational

- Release reproducibility template
  - Lightweight config snapshot for external replication
  - YAML configs + run metadata + step-by-step instructions
  - Enable community comparisons and extensions

- Draft preprint
  - Assemble results from milestones above
  - Target: submission once POSYDON integrated and full cross-code study complete
  - Timeline: Q1-Q2 2026

## Current Blockers

- **COMPAS AWS Grid:** Awaiting cluster allocation for production 40-combo run
- **POSYDON Grids:** Download and validation needed before integration
- **Full Training Run:** Depends on COMPAS production ensemble completion

## Updated: December 2025
